# ClimatiX - The IoT way reading data points and manipulating as an example lights, heating, ventilation

## Artificial, micro, small scale- ecosystem simulation ## 

### User input defines the optimal circumstances and tolerance for optimal values regarding: 
-temp
-humidity %
-light as Lumens
-o2-sensor

Additionally the Arduino (or a cheap copy) absolutely may control reading all the important temps, humid %. light as measured in Lumens, and especially the o2 sensor should, when the carbon-dioxide raises, sound an alarm to stop the exhaust fan blowing briefly, maybe even push some nutrient-filled air on top of your plant to specificly give it a boost. Don't remember to give water/nutrient solution., more light if possible and  rise the temp. a little bit.
