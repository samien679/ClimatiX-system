# ECOsystem

## Artificial, micro, small scale- ecosystem simulation ## 

### User input defines the optimal circumstances and tolerance for optimal values regarding: 
temp
humidity %
light as Lumens
o2-sensor

Threshold for specific measurable values serve as an MVP feature where data with sensor logs and user input combine rendering the testing environment, as using the app to generate relevant data on the server.
